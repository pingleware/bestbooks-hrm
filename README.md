By following these steps, organizations can ensure a positive off-boarding experience for departing employees, maintain good relationships, and protect the company's interests.

# New Hire Federal Required Forms

When hiring a new employee in the United States, employers are required to complete several federal forms to comply with various regulations and document important information. The specific forms may vary based on the nature of the employment and the individual's eligibility status. Here are some commonly required federal forms for a new hire:

1. **[Form W-4, Employee&#39;s Withholding Certificate](assets/fw4.pdf):**

   - This form is used to determine the amount of federal income tax to withhold from an employee's paycheck. It includes information about the employee's filing status and allowances.
2. **[Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification](assets/i-9.pdf):**

   - Employers must complete and retain Form I-9 for each employee to verify their identity and employment authorization. This form ensures that the employee is legally eligible to work in the United States.
3. **[Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification (for independent contractors)](assets/fw9.pdf):**

   - If hiring an independent contractor, employers may need to request a completed Form W-9 to obtain the contractor's taxpayer identification number (TIN) for reporting purposes.
4. **[Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number (EIN)](assets/fss4-2.pdf):**

   - If the employer doesn't have an EIN, they may need to obtain one by completing Form SS-4. This form is used to apply for an employer identification number, which is required for tax reporting purposes.
5. **[New Hire Reporting](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/contact-information/state-new-hire-reporting-websites):**

   - Some states require employers to report new hires to the state's new hire registry. While not a federal form, this process helps state agencies locate parents to enforce child support orders.
6. **[Form 8850, Pre-Screening Notice and Certification Request for the Work Opportunity Credit](assets/f8850.pdf):**

   - Employers may use this form to pre-screen job applicants for eligibility under the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program.
7. **[Form 1099-NEC (for independent contractors)](assets/f1099nec.pdf):**

   - If payments to an independent contractor total $600 or more during the tax year, employers must report these payments using Form 1099-NEC.
8. **[Form 941, Employer&#39;s Quarterly Federal Tax Return](assets/f941.pdf):**

   - Employers must file Form 941 to report income taxes, Social Security tax, or Medicare tax withheld from employee's paychecks. This form is typically filed quarterly.

It's essential to note that state and local governments may have additional requirements, so employers should check with their state's labor or workforce agency to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. Additionally, the IRS provides updated forms and instructions on their official website, so employers should refer to the most current versions when onboarding new hires.

It's important to note that the classification of workers as independent contractors or employees is subject to specific criteria set by tax and labor laws. Misclassification can have legal and financial consequences, so it's crucial to determine the proper classification for each worker.

Additionally, businesses should keep accurate records of payments to independent contractors, including contracts, invoices, and any relevant tax documentation. Compliance with tax regulations, including issuing 1099 forms to independent contractors as required, is essential.

As always, consulting with a professional accountant or tax advisor is recommended to ensure that the accounting entries align with the specific requirements of the business and comply with relevant tax laws and regulations.
